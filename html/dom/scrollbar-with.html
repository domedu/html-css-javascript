      JavaScript is great, and by all means use it, while also being aware that
      you can build so many functional UI components without the additional
      dependancy. Maybe you can include a few lines of utility code, or a mixin,
      and forgo the requirement. If you're only targeting more modern browsers,
      you might not need anything more than what the browser ships with. This
      site is fully copied from youmightnotneedjquery.com, an excellent resource
      for vanilla JavaScript created by @adamfschwartz and @zackbloom. But this
      time, we take a look at the power of modern native HTML and CSS as well as
      some of the syntactic sugar of Sass. Because, you might not need scripts
      for that task at all! (Note: Some of these demos may not be accessible and
      work on all browsers. Please take a moment to review the usage notes and
      to test them in your project before using in production)

    <script>
      let box = document.querySelector("div.box");
      let scrollbarWith = box.offsetWidth - box.clientWidth;
      console.log("scrollbarWith:", scrollbarWith);
